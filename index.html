    <h1>MY SEARCH FOR OPEN SOURCE RESOURCES</h1>
    <p><em>by Ed Irvine</em></p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am relatively new to downloading files and apps off the internet.  Because of my lack of knowledge regarding downloading from the web and my security concerns, I am hesitant to do this.  However, I recognize that open source apps and downloads will be valuable tools and resources in my career. So, here we go!!</p>
    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>I will be going about this process in the following order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Contact a friend who is much more knowledgeable than me when it comes to computers</li>
      <li>Do a Google search regarding downloading do's and don'ts</li>
      <li>Start downloading and learn as I go</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Contact from Friend</h2>
    <p>My friend suggested what i already assumed; download from a reputable source.  However, he did inform me that I should extract any zipped files and then scan with my anti-virus after extraction, as some compressed folders cannot be scanned by antivirus software.  I was unaware of this, so will be going through this process. His other suggestion was to create a <strong>virtual machine</strong>, which I am definitely <strong>NOT</strong> doing at this point.</p>
    <h2>Google Search</h2>
    <p>I found a very resourceful article on the <a href="https://wikihow.com">wikiHow</a> site that very much helped.  First, it also mentioned to <strong><em>know</em></strong> the site.  If it is reputable, and seems to be a quality site, then chances are it is safe to download from.  It also said to watch when downloading for executable files, such as <strong>.exe, .bat, .pif,</strong> and <strong>.scr</strong>.  Another warning was to check the file size, and if it was too small or too large then it may be harmful. The article was quite well written, and I trust it.</p>
    <h2>Actual Downloading</h2>
    <p>Since I require resources for the sample web-page I am developing for CPNT 260, I decided to download images and a logo that relate to my page's topic.  Since I am going to be designing a page for a mock electrical contractor, the files I will be downloading will relate to this topic.</p>
    <p>My first step was to review the Open Source Asset Cheat Sheet from the WBDV 2021 website.  It lead me to <a href="https://www.pixabay.com">Pixabay</a>, and from there I found <a href="https://www.pexel.com">Pexel</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.  I was also able to find an SVG logo from a site called <a href="https://www.freesvg.org">Free SVG</a>.</p>
    <p>It was a good experience.  I learned some things, such as the fact that it is easy to click on images that are actually part of paid advertisements.  But once I learned to navigate the sites, I realized how easy it is to download images that are licensed for any use.  I also was pleased to find that the licenses were easy to find and interpret, which helped me confidently download the files.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My experience with this assignment has helped me begin to overcome a fear I have of using the internet and my computer.  I have increased my knowledge of what downloading files and apps involves, and I will continue to do so.</p>
